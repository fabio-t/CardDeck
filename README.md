CardDeck
========

A small program developed for a job interview. The intention is to convert it in Erlang for training purposes, and it might become something useful, just by chance :P

This is an Eclipse Project, with a .classpath and a .project included.

The src/ directory contains three source files:

- Deck.java
- Card.java
- UnitTests.java

**Deck.java** defines the Deck class, implementing the three public methods required. 

In **Card.java** there is the class which represents a single card. It implements Comparable, thus making it easy to integrate in the Java Collections Framework.

**UnitTests.java** contains the unit tests.

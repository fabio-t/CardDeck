This is an Eclipse Project, with a .classpath and a .project included.

The src/ directory contains three source files:

Deck.java
Card.java
UnitTests.java

Deck.java defines the Deck class, implementing the three public methods required. 

In Card.java there is the class which represents a single card. It implements Comparable, thus making it easy to integrate in the Java Collections Framework.

UnitTests.java contains the unit tests.

The code is also visible on my GIT repository: https://bitbucket.org/fabioticconi/carddeck
